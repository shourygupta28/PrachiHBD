                <h3><p>In the stillness of the night, under the vast expanse of sky,</p>
                <p>I stood in awe as you whispered your love, making my heart fly.</p>
            <p>It was March 8th, 11:11, a moment etched in time,</p>
        <p>You proposed with such grace, your love so sublime.</p>
                    
                   <p>On the rooftop, amidst the chilly breeze, I stood amazed,</p>
                <p>Your love enveloped me, in its warmth, I was dazed.</p>
            <p>Three years together, yet it feels like a dream,</p>
        <p>With you, every moment is brighter than it may seem.</p>
                    
                    <p>You are the one who plans our dates, making memories divine,</p>
                <p>In your eyes, every adventure becomes a sign.</p>
            <p>Through the fights and the laughter, we find our way,</p>
        <p>For in your love, I discover strength every day.</p>
                    
                    <p>I admire your efforts, your care, your touch so sweet,</p>
                <p>You're the melody in my life's ever-changing beat.</p>
            <p>Together, we've weathered storms, emerged stronger too,</p>
        <p>In your arms, I find home, so pure and true.</p>
                    
                    <p>On this special day, as the candles glow bright,</p>
                <p>I wish you joy and love, from morning till night.</p>
            <p>May your smile shine as bright as the stars above,</p>
        <p>Happy birthday, my love, you're my forever love.</p>
